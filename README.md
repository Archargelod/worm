# worm
*worm* is a floating, tag-based window manager for X11. It is written in the Rust programming language, using the X11RB library.

## Install
`cargo build --release`
In the target/release directory you should find two binaries, `worm` and `wormc`. Put them somewhere in your path, and then launch as usual - whether with a display manager or via startx (~/.xinitrc).
